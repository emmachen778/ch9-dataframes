# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games of their season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores")
scores <- c(48, 20, 26, 17)
# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
scores.against <- c(17, 13, 13, 13)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
games <- data.frame(scores, scores.against)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
games$diff <- games$scores - games$scores.against

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
games$won <- games$diff > 0

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c('Chargers', 'Vikings', 'Chiefs', 'Raiders')

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(games) <- opponents
